          What are the major benefits of Microsoft Q&A versus MSDN and TechNet
          forums?
          <ul>
            Microsoft Q&A uses the same user authentication as Microsoft Docs
            and Learn content for a more consistent experience across the
            platform. This integrated experience allows us to better prioritize
            and answer questions, and give users clearer paths between
            documentation, learning content, and answers. Microsoft Q&A also
            offers a much better set of permissions that equips our moderators
            with improved tools to insure healthy engagement on the site.

          What are the major benefits of Microsoft Q&A versus Stack Overflow?
          <ul>
            We love Stack Overflow. We will continue supporting our customers
            who ask questions there. We also surface answers from Stack Overflow
            on Microsoft Q&A.

          What is the difference between Microsoft Q&A and Microsoft Tech
          Community?
          <ul>
            Microsoft Q&A is first party experience for technical answers on
            Microsoft products. Developers and IT pros can solve problems with
            the help of community experts and Microsoft engineering. The
            experience includes a rich knowledgebase which ingests content from
            a variety of sources (e.g., MSDN Forums, Stack Overflow) to help
            customers get the answers they need quickly.
